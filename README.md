# DataStructuresRepoGregTarr

Final Project for Data Structures in Java.  This application is a virtual bartender that allows users to select spirits they have on hand, and returns them a list of cocktail recipes they can create with their ingredients.  

This was my first major Java project; my primary goal was to select the most efficient data structure for this application.  I ended up using a binary tree, but I will re-visit this when I restructure and expand upon this App.  As part of this project, I learned the javax.swing package and implemented it for the application GUI.  Also, I utilized Javadoc notation throughout development.
